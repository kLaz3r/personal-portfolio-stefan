# Stefan's Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio, a modern and dynamic web application designed to showcase my skills in web development, design, and photography. This project is built with a focus on performance, aesthetics, and a clean user experience.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
*   **Interactive UI**: Engaging animations and transitions, powered by `motion`, create a dynamic and enjoyable user experience.
*   **Project Showcase**: A dedicated section to display my latest projects, complete with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos and source code.
*   **Photography Gallery**: A beautiful, masonry-style photo gallery to showcase my passion for photography, with a lightbox for viewing full-size images.
*   **Automated Image Processing**: A Python script automates the generation of the photo gallery data, ensuring efficiency and consistency.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio is built with a modern tech stack, including:

*   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
*   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **Animations**: [Motion](https.com/motion/)
*   **Photo Gallery**: [Yet Another React Lightbox](https://yet-another-react-lightbox.com/) & [React Photo Album](https://react-photo-album.com/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v20 or later)
*   npm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kLaz3r/personal-portfolio-stefan.git
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the development server
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Photo Gallery Automation

The photo gallery data in `src/data/photos.ts` is automatically generated by the Python script `generate-image-array.py`. This script:

1.  Scans the `public/images` directory for images.
2.  Calculates the aspect ratio of each image.
3.  Generates a TypeScript file with an array of photo objects, including the `src`, `width`, and `height`.

This automation simplifies the process of adding new photos to the gallery and ensures that the data is always up-to-date.

To run the script, you'll need Python and the Pillow library:

```sh
pip install Pillow
python generate-image-array.py
```
